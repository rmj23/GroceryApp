# Grocery App – Web (React + Vite)

This is the **frontend** for the Grocery App, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (LTS is recommended)
- npm (comes with Node)

---

## Install dependencies

From this directory:

```bash
cd "/Users/rubenmoralesjr/Desktop/personal/grocery app/apps/web"
npm install
```

Run this once to install all required packages.

---

## Run the app locally (development)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal, typically:

- `http://localhost:54522`

The app will automatically reload when you edit files under `src/`.

---

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist` folder.

You can preview the production build locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

---

## Linting

To run ESLint checks:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Fix any reported issues to keep the codebase clean and consistent.
